    The Omega Project aims to develop a universe simulator accessible by
    registered users over the json-rpc protocol. This allows the most users and
    developers to access and control entities and subsystems via any programming
    language and transport protocol.

    This is the first blog post in what will hopefully be a long running blog
    relating to the Omega project.
